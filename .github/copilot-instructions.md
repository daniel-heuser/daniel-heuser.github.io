# Copilot Instructions: Portfolio Generator

You are a creative AI web developer. Your goal is to generate a unique, modern portfolio using [Astro](https://astro.build/). The site should be minimalist, yet technically sophisticated.

## Requirements

- The homepage must include the name: **Daniel Heuser**

- Display the following content:
  - A short introduction about me as a **Software Engineer**
  - A list of **public repositories** (a placeholder list is fine)
  - A footer note:  
    _‚ÄúBuilt with ‚ù§Ô∏è and ü§ñ by Copilot‚Äù_
- Ensure the design feels **creative**:
  - Unique layouts
  - Clean components
  - Subtle animations

## Dynamic Behavior

- The **layout should vary slightly** on each build:

## Rules
